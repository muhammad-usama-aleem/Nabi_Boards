                A little history of why I love doing what I am doing. My name is
                Jan Gorsek and I am from Slovenia. I started with skateboarding
                when I was a young kid. Everyone was doing it at that time. I
                bought my first skateboard when I was 13 years old. And I
                learned Olie (stationary jump) in like 4 hours. And it was an
                awesome feeling. And because skateboarding was very tough my
                friends abandoned it and I also didn’t want to do it alone. So I
                quit skateboarding. At the age of 16, I learned to snowboard and
                I never went back to skiing.

            After that, I went to a kitesurfing school and I loved it. I still
            love it today. The speed the wind the jumping the freedom it gives
            you. It’s just the best feeling ever. But I had one problem. There
            was almost no wind where I was on vacation. in Croatia in summer the
            wind is very poor. I had to wait 2 weeks for a medium-strong wind to
            show up on Windguru (A forecast site for weather). And even then I
            needed to be lucky for the wind to show up. So like 50% of the time
            I got stuck on the beach waiting for the wind. That’s why I started
            looking on the internet for alternative ways to ride when there is
            no wind. That’s how I found the electric skateboard and foil. And I
            have to say its the best feeling ever. Not a lot of people have the
            guts to try it. But once you do you will get hooked. So I want the
            world to be able to ride whenever they feel like it and not wait for
            the optimum conditions. It doesn’t matter if you live in the City in
            a Village or in the Hills.
